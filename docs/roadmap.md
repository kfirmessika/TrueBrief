## 0. Where we are today (honest snapshot)

A working news-intelligence app: create topics → scheduled scans collect articles → harvester
extracts atomic facts → arbiter dedups (NEW/UPDATE/DUPLICATE) → briefs render on the topic page.
Auth (Clerk), billing scaffolding (Paddle), email digest, web push, rate limiting, and deployment
(Railway + Vercel) all exist. The V3 quality/cost migration (M1) is done **behind feature flags**.

**What works in the product right now:** dashboard feed, sidebar topic list, topic page with
briefs (🆕 NEW / 📈 UPDATES envelope), source chips, live scan progress, settings, admin metrics +
**full per-run pipeline trace** (`/admin/runs`).

**Built but gated/blocked:** V3 quality flags (ON locally, **OFF in Railway**); batch judge
(`V3_BATCH_JUDGE`, off, pending A/B); email digest (built, blocked on a verified domain).

**Designed & agreed but NOT built** (see §4 — they all sit on the delta engine):
the per-user **delta engine**, the **smart history page**, the **calm v3-briefing surface**, and the
**in-app daily digest**.

**The plan in one line (revised 2026-06-19 — see §1 Launch Decision):** the current brief lost a
head-to-head vs GPT, so we **build full V3 — new pipeline (IC1–IC8 + 1a.5) + new UI (delta engine →
calm surface → history → digest) — _before_ launch**, with an objective gate (beat GPT on
signal-vs-noise) and a Phase-1 checkpoint that proves the *data* before we build the *UI*. Heavy/uncertain
infra (adaptive AYR, budget controller, B2B, billing) stays post-launch.

---

## 1. 🚀 LAUNCH PATH — the ordered critical path to go live

### 🔒 LAUNCH DECISION (2026-06-19): Full V3 — new pipeline + new UI — BEFORE launch

**Why (founder call).** We're a *specialized single-tool* news subscription competing with *multi-tool*
general AIs. Our only reason to exist is **more signal / less noise than a general AI (GPT) on the same
topic.** The 2026-06-19 benchmark showed we currently *lose* that comparison — so launching now = zero
advantage. We win the benchmark first, then launch.

**🎯 Objective launch gate (the finite line — launch the instant it passes, then freeze scope):**
re-run the benchmark on **Iran-War + 2 more topics** → our output **beats GPT on signal-vs-noise**:
IC8 golden-case assertions pass **and** a blind side-by-side reads as *ours leads with the lede / less
repetitive / synthesized*. Not a feeling — a diff. **Nothing new is added to the pre-launch list after this.**

**IN (pre-launch):** new pipeline (IC1–IC8 + 1a.5) + new UI (delta engine, calm surface, history,
digest — *minimum-viable* versions).
**OUT (post-launch — "stuff to figure out / too complex"):** adaptive & cost-aware AYR + budget
controller + cost-model Option B (§4-E); B2B API (§5 Phase 4); full contradiction detector, feedback
loop, domain pipelines, linked-graph, timing learning, multi-language (§5 Phase 5/6); **paid billing**
(soft launch is free, so §6 blockers + L2 stay post-launch).

**Ordered build:**

- **P0 — Unblock embeddings ✅ DONE.** Fixed embed_batch (SDK bug: list→1 vector). (commit de33eca)
- **P1 — Keystone: published_at for Tavily/Brave ✅ DONE.** Tavily returns `published_date` (RFC 2822)
  — we weren't reading it. Now parsed. Brave: `page_age` parsed when present. Harvester date guard now
  always anchors to `today` when pub date still unknown — kills 2020/2023 LLM hallucinations outright.
  (commit de80714)
- **Phase 1 — Pipeline to content-parity (the data wins the benchmark):** `1a.5` two-clock dev-lag gate ·
  `IC1` tally collapse · `IC2` event-class ranking · `IC3` dedup-fires · `IC4` contradiction flag ·
  `IC8` golden-case harness. *(specs: §2 1a.5, §2.5)*
  - **🆕 P2 — Freshness/adaptive-K ✅ DONE.** (root-cause finding 2026-06-19) MMR had no recency term →
    old well-covered stories won the 5 slots on hot days. MAX_ARTICLES=5 was static → on a 45-article
    day we read 11%. Fixed: MMR_RECENCY=0.15 weight with 36h half-life decay; MIN_K=5/MAX_K=20 adaptive.
    Also: IC3 same-event fast-path + telemetry zero-count fix. (commit 5d25c0e)
  - **🔶 CHECKPOINT (de-risks the whole bet): re-run the benchmark. Our _content_ must already beat
    GPT — _before_ any UI work.** Pass → UI is pure upside on proven facts. Fail → fix the pipeline, don't move on.
    - **2026-06-20 re-run (Trump topic) — DATA LAYER PASSES, SYNTHESIS LAYER FAILS.** Keystone confirmed:
      brief is now temporally coherent (no 2020/2023 contamination, no old/new mix). But still loses to GPT on
      **synthesis/presentation, not data**: (1) buries the lede — leads with CFPB, not the Iran deal GPT names
      as #1; (2) no "biggest story" synthesis line; (3) `WHAT'S NEW/FULL CONTEXT` labels + doubled chips
      (`huffpost.comhuffpost.com`) still render; (4) Middle East fragmented into 3 overlapping sections;
      (5) missed freshest items (Air Force One/Qatar 747, Pulte→DNI, FISA 702, AI EO). → Next: **IC7** (state-of-play,
      closes 1+2+4) then **IC5/IC6** (cheap presentation) then **IC4/IC8**. Checkpoint re-runs after IC7.
- **Phase 2 — New UI (experience on proven-good content):** `4-A` delta engine · `IC7` state-of-play
  header · `4-C` calm surface + kill live briefer *(IC5/IC6 are **absorbed** — the calm surface is built
  right by design; no effort wasted fixing the old briefer)* · `4-B` history page · `4-D` daily digest.
  *(specs: §4-A/B/C/D, §2.5 IC7)*
- **Then launch:** the L1 mechanics below (deploy → flip flags → smoke) → invite free users.

> **Guardrail against the delay pattern:** the gate is the *benchmark diff*, the scope is *frozen* at the
> IN-list, and the Phase-1 checkpoint proves the core before we invest in UI. If we're tempted to add
> anything not on the IN-list, it goes to post-launch — no exceptions.

---

> Two tiers below: **Soft** (free, no money) then **Public/Paid** (needs domain + billing, now post-launch).

### L0 — Make the live pipeline debuggable ✅ DONE (de-risks everything after)
- [x] **A.7 Pipeline Observability / Admin Trace Panel** — per-run trace of the whole pipeline
      (query+tools chosen & why → articles each tool returned → MMR selection → exact LLM
      prompt/response per stage → per-fact judge decisions). Founder-only `/admin/runs/{id}`.
      Migration 012 applied to Supabase 2026-06-18.

### L1 — Soft launch (free tier only — no domain/billing needed)
- [ ] **S0. Push backend to Railway** — deploy current `main` so prod runs the new model
      (gemini-3.1-flash-lite), UCB1 rotator, A.7 trace capture, and batch-judge code. (C: 2)
- [ ] **S1. Flip V3 flags ON in Railway env** — `V3_DATE_GUARD`, `V3_RELEVANCE_GATE`,
      `V3_ENTITY_DEDUP`, `V3_PAUSE_STORY_GRAPH` (they're already ON locally, still False in prod). (C: 1)
- [ ] **S2. Verify model quota on prod key** — confirm `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` has real daily
      quota. **CONFIRMED BLOCKER (smoke test 2026-06-19):** dev key batch-embed returns 1 vector for
      any N inputs → MMR falls back → relevance gate over-fires (dropped 14/15 facts in one scan).
      Briefs still produce but quality is unreliable. Must verify prod key before deploy. (C: 3)
- [ ] **S3. Smoke-scan 3 real topics** — run each, open `/admin/runs` to confirm dates / relevance
      gate / dedup behave and cost looks right. Gate with `python scripts/preflight.py --base-url …`. (C: 4)
- [x] **S4. Frontend CI green** — removed stale `topics.intg`/`briefs.intg` suites + fixed drifted
      assertions. 16/16 tests pass, `npm run build` PASS. (done 2026-06-19)
- [ ] **S5. Invite 5–10 free users** on the bare Vercel/Railway URLs — everyone free tier, no
      emails, no payments. Watch `/admin/runs` + `/admin/metrics` daily. (C: 2)

### L2 — Public / paid launch (needs the pre-launch blockers in §6)
- [ ] **P1. Buy domain** → unblocks Resend + Paddle + Clerk prod.
- [ ] **P2. Resend:** verify domain, set `DIGEST_FROM_EMAIL=briefs@<domain>`.
- [ ] **P3. Paddle:** finish merchant setup with the live URL; set price/keys; smoke a test checkout.
- [ ] **P4. Clerk:** swap dev instance → production instance.
- [x] **P5. Pre-Production Smoke Gate** — `scripts/preflight.py` (secrets, no `-preview` model,
      Supabase, **migration 012 applied**, `/health` + public API). Exit 1 blocks launch.

---

## 2. V3 Pipeline Migration (M1 quality/cost diffs)

> Architecture build-sequence steps 1–7. Flags default **False** = V1 preserved; flip per-flag after A/B.

- [x] Switch model → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (stable; fixes the daily-quota=0 trap)
- [x] 1a.1 Date/year guard in harvester (`V3_DATE_GUARD`)
- [x] 1a.2 Relevance gate — drop off-topic facts (`V3_RELEVANCE_GATE`)
- [x] 1a.3 Entity-aware dedup in arbiter (`V3_ENTITY_DEDUP`)
- [x] 1a.4 Pause story graph + summarizer; hide Stories tab (`V3_PAUSE_STORY_GRAPH`)
- [x] UCB1 query rotator — 1 lifetime LLM call/topic, cached in `topics.search_strategy`
- [x] 1b.1 Batch grey-zone judge (`V3_BATCH_JUDGE`) — `judge.call_batch()` + `arbiter.judge_alphas()`,
      off by default; enable after M2 A/B confirms quality
- [ ] **1a.5 Two-clock dev-lag gate** (`published_at` on the fact + `date_basis` + lag classifier) —
      §8B. Decides "breaking" vs "framed" vs "history backfill". **Prereq for the smart history page.** (C: 10 | SONNET)
- [x] **1b.2 URL/article dedup** — exact-URL skip (14d window in `VectorStore.get_seen_urls()`) +
      near-dup/syndication collapse (`V3_NEARDUP_COLLAPSE`): SimHash-64 / Hamming≤3 drops wire-story
      copies before extraction. 6 unit tests; wired in `runner.py` step 2c.
- [ ] 1b.3 Gate scans on new content (quiet-scan = $0) (C: 6 | FLASH)
- [ ] 1b.4 Drop the live-path briefer — assemble from `fact`+`context` (folds into §4-C below) (C: 8 | SONNET)

### M2 — Measure + validate (the gate before building more)
- [ ] **A.2 Accuracy Test Harness** — golden set; CI report on gate recall, scoring precision/recall,
      digest precision@5 (north-star ≥ 80%). Treat scoring quality as the product. (C: 18 | SONNET)
- [ ] A/B the V3 flags on real scans — call count / tokens / cost / dedup quality vs V1 baseline,
      read from `pipeline_run` + `llm_call_log` via `/admin/metrics`. (C: 6)

---

## 2.5 🔧 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIONS (from the 2026-06-19 GPT benchmark)

> A head-to-head on **"Iran War" vs GPT** (same topic, same day) exposed **3 data leaks + 4 presentation gaps**. Verdict: GPT's brief was more useful — it led with the lede (signed US–Iran framework + ceasefire), stayed tight, and synthesized; ours buried the peace deal under casualties, showed 5 overlapping tallies as separate "new" items, repeated a fact (dedup miss), and had no "so what".
> **Sequencing rule (so we don't repeat mistakes):** the **data fixes are durable** — they fix `facts` rows, so every surface benefits *and* they survive the briefer removal (4-C). Do them first. The **presentation fixes** make the soft-launch brief readable now; their full form rides 4-C. Each correction also becomes a **golden-set case** (IC8 → A.2).
> Architecture spec: §10B.2a/b (development-type + tally-collapse), §5 (dedup + contradiction), §7 (state of play), §13 (hierarchy + labels), §16 red light #5.

### 2.5-A Data / pipeline fixes — durable, DO NOW (before soft launch)
- [x] **IC1. Running-total collapse** (arch §10B.2b) — arbiter step 1b: tally fact + entity-overlap
      ≥ 0.5 → force UPDATE (bypass vector threshold). `find_tally_match()` in vector_store. Flag
      `V3_TALLY_COLLAPSE`. Migration 013 applied 2026-06-19. 15 tests. (commit de33eca)
- [x] **IC2. Event-class + significance weighting** (arch §10B.2a) — harvester emits
      `event_class ∈ {state_change, escalation, development, incremental, tally, routine}`;
      runner step 5d sorts decisions by weight before briefer → state_change leads. Flag
      `V3_DEV_CLASS_RANK`. Alpha model + migration 013. (commit de33eca)
- [x] **P0. embed_batch fix** — Gemini SDK treated contents=list as one doc → 1 vector for N
      inputs. Fixed: ThreadPoolExecutor(8) dispatches one call per text → 7x faster, all N vectors
      returned. All quality gates (MMR, relevance gate, entity-dedup) now work correctly. (commit de33eca)
- [x] **IC3. Entity-dedup must fire on same-event facts** (1a.3 validation) — "4 Israeli soldiers killed" ×2
      (same date + entities + number) must merge to **one fact, `verified_count=2`**. Triple gate: entity_overlap≥0.80
      + temporal_overlap≥0.97 + raw_sim≥0.50 → DUPLICATE without LLM call. (commit 5d25c0e)
- [ ] **IC4. Contradiction flag at merge** (arch §5/§8B — cheap precursor to Phase-5) — two facts on the same
      `(metric/event, entities, overlapping dates)` with **different values** (Hormuz open vs closed; toll 3,912
      vs 3,468) → flag the pair, don't store deadpan (a contradiction is usually the story). *Accept:* the
      Hormuz pair renders as one flagged contradiction. Flag `V3_CONTRADICTION_FLAG`. (C: 12 | SONNET)

### 2.5-B Presentation / synthesis
> **Per the 2026-06-19 Launch Decision (§1):** we now build the **new calm surface (4-C)** rather than
> launch on the old briefer — so **IC5 + IC6 are absorbed into 4-C** (built right by design, not retro-fitted).
> **IC7 (state of play)** and **IC8 (golden case)** remain live pre-launch tasks (Phase 1/2).
- [x] **IC5. Drop `WHAT'S NEW / FULL CONTEXT` labels + de-dupe source chips** — briefer prompt rewritten to
      weave `context` as prose (no rigid labels) + "one chip per OUTLET" rule; frontend `parseSourceLine`
      now de-dupes chips by domain (kills `cnn.comcnn.com`). 6 unit tests in test_briefer.py. (commit pending)
- [x] **IC6. Importance hierarchy in the brief** — briefer now receives `significance` (event_class) +
      `corroborating_sources` per fact, preserves IC2 sort, leads with a **📌 Bottom line** synthesis line,
      and collapses running tallies into one bullet. *needs IC2 (done).* (commit pending)
- [ ] **IC7. "State of play" topic-header block** (arch §7) — grounded status line + 3–6 item ✅/⚠️ checklist of
      open threads (`agreed/contested/postponed/escalating`), generated **only from our facts + sources**,
      regenerated only on a `state_change` (batched, ~1 call), **no prediction**. *Accept:* topic header shows the
      GPT-style status, fully sourced. (C: 12 | SONNET)
- [ ] **IC8. Golden case from this benchmark** (feeds A.2) — encode the labeled failures from
      `docs/benchmarks/2026-06-19_iran-war_gpt-vs-truebrief.md` as regression assertions: buried lede, tally
      collapse, duplicated soldiers fact, Hormuz contradiction, missing state-of-play. *Accept:* A.2 asserts all
      fixed. (C: 5 | SONNET)

**Order (revised after 2026-06-21 re-run):** IC1 ✅ → IC2 ✅ → IC3 ✅ → IC5 ✅ → IC6 ✅. **2026-06-21
benchmark (Iran War): all four axes jumped to 7/10** (from 3–5) — bottom-line lede + prose weaving landed.
Still lose **28 vs 37** but the gap is now **completeness** (reference had the signed-agreement framing + 6
context facts we missed), not presentation. Also our lede picked Hormuz-closure over the signed deal → IC7
(state-of-play) should fix lede-salience. Next: **IC7** (highest leverage, closes the buried-lede + no-synthesis
gaps) → **IC4** (contradiction) → **IC8** (golden case). *(Harness bug fixed: benchmark now uses a real temp
topic so known_facts FK + cross-run dedup actually work.)*
<!-- superseded order: IC7 → IC5 → IC6 -->
needs IC2) → **IC4** (contradiction) → **IC8** (golden case, encodes both benchmarks). Re-run the §1 checkpoint
after IC7. **How (architecture):** IC7 = `architecture_v3.md` §7.4 (topic-header status block, facts-only,
regenerated on `state_change`, ~1 batched call); IC6 = §13 hierarchy + §10B.2a event-class weight (IC2 already live).

---

## 3. ✅ DONE (collapsed)

- **Phase 0–2:** project skeleton, core MVP, delta-engine-v1 + scheduling.
- **Phase 3 (frontend + monetization):** 3.1–3.20 done — story nodes, dual vectors, Stripe→Paddle,
  tier enforcement, Next.js skeleton, Clerk auth, topic mgmt UI, brief display, landing, time-saved
  metric, public sharing, email digest, web push, mobile-responsive, rate limiting, Brave+Exa,
  Railway+Vercel deploy. (3.10 standalone history route **removed** — history is inline now.
  3.12 onboarding **cancelled** — decided unnecessary.)
- **Phase A (backend validation):** A.1 cost/latency telemetry, A.4 failure-mode tests,
  A.6 admin metrics, **A.7 trace panel**.
- **Phase B (design system):** B.0 OKLCH tokens + dark mode + primitives, B.1 critical gaps
  (topic detail tabs, settings, source chips, live scan bar).
- **Ops:** migration 012 applied; `scripts/preflight.py` launch gate; frontend CI green;
  **E2E smoke harness** (`scripts/smoke_scan.py`) + **test plan** (`docs/testing.md`) built;
  real scan on 2 prod topics passed all 7 quality invariants (2026-06-19).

---

## 4. PRODUCT SURFACES — the delta engine, calm brief, history page, daily digest

> **⬆️ MOVED TO PRE-LAUNCH (2026-06-19 — see §1 Launch Decision).** These were "post-launch"; the GPT
> benchmark flipped that — they're now **Phase 2** of the pre-launch build (after the Phase-1 pipeline
> checkpoint proves content parity). Build *minimum-viable* versions in the dependency order below.
> 4-E stays **post-launch** (heavy/uncertain infra). Maps to architecture build-sequence #8–11.

### 4-A. Delta engine + `user_topic_state` — THE UNLOCK (build-seq #10) [START HERE post-launch]
- [ ] `user_topic_state` table with two markers: `last_seen_at` (live) + `last_digest_at` (digest).
- [ ] Per-user **delta query** — Home = "what's new for *this* user since their anchor", **$0 LLM**,
      pure Postgres; advance `last_seen_at` on view. "All quiet" is a first-class hero state.
- [ ] **Gate the feed on development recency, not `first_seen_at`** (needs 1a.5) — a fact dated a year
      ago but first-seen today belongs in history, not at the top of today.
      (C: 16 | SONNET) — *history, briefs, and digest all sit on this.*

### 4-B. Smart history page (build-seq #9 + §8B backfill)
- [ ] **No-LLM-first timeline** — render the topic's "story so far" by ordering the already-clean
      fact-sentences chronologically, **zero LLM**. Evaluate readability; add *one* glue/summary pass
      only if choppy.
- [ ] **Backfill-of-misses (§8B):** a large-lag fact that *connects* to the existing timeline
      (entity overlap / known thread / corroborated) is written to history silently and surfaced in
      the feed only as "filling a gap — Mar 2025", never as breaking. Orphans → muted-items log.
- [ ] UI: "tap a story → story-so-far expands in place" (not a separate route); full timeline is the
      power/B2B view. (C: 15 | SONNET) — *depends on 4-A + 1a.5.*

### 4-C. Calm v3-briefing surface + kill the live briefer (build-seq #4, roadmap B.REF→B.2)
- [ ] **B.REF Design reference** — founder generates/validates the mockup (Google AI Studio / Claude.ai),
      brings the approved reference here. *(Founder task — gates the code below.)*
- [ ] Implement the radically-subtracted home: `● 3 new today`, plain sentences, inline `context` on
      tap, "All caught up." hero state. Kill: Stories tab, stat bars, chat-bubble feed.
- [ ] **Assemble briefs from `fact`+`context`** instead of regenerating (drops the live-path briefer →
      cheaper). (C: 18 | SONNET) — *depends on 4-A; reads best with 4-B.*

### 4-D. Daily digest envelope (build-seq #11)
- [ ] **One feed, two envelopes** — the "daily summary" is NOT a second screen: same delta feed,
      digest header ceremony (`Your brief · Tue Jun 16`, grouped by topic, "That's everything"),
      auto-picked by time-since-last-look using `last_digest_at`.
- [ ] In-app dated digest card + a *digest hour* preference + a *breaking toggle* (push on
      high-importance). Email digest already exists — wire it to the same engine. (C: 12 | SONNET)
      — *depends on 4-A; email delivery still needs the domain (§6).*

### 4-E. Adaptive scanning & cost control (build-seq #8, 13) — ⛔ STAYS POST-LAUNCH (OUT of the pre-launch gate)
- [ ] Spike-responsive AYR (snap up on surprise, decay gently) + per-(topic×tool) AYR + coalescing
      window. (C: 18 | SONNET)
- [ ] Budget controller (once telemetry can predict) + soft/hard limits + margin shield. (C: 15 | SONNET)
- [ ] Trust UX: viewable muted-items log ("212 items muted — view"). (C: 5 | FLASH)

---

## 5. Later / at scale (do NOT block go-live)

- **Phase B.3–B.5:** polish (optimistic mutations, transitions, OG images), copy/brand, a11y + mobile.
- **Phase C:** C.1 Playwright E2E, C.2 API contract types, C.3 perf budget, C.4 load/stress.
- **Phase A deferred:** A.3 longitudinal stress sims, A.5 competitor benchmark.
- **Phase 4 — B2B API:** public REST + auth, `/delta`, `/nodes`, webhooks, usage billing, versioning.
  (Architecture says B2B over-indexes vs B2C — the real money. Compliance/regulatory wedge first.)
- **Phase 5 — scale + moat:** plugins, global AYR network, feedback loop (Rocchio + learned
  pre-filter), contradiction detection, multi-language, teams/org, white-label, mobile app.
- **Phase 6 — domain pipelines:** domain router brain, finance/legal/medical pipelines.
- **Build-seq #14–15:** timing/pattern scan learning (the social-pivot moat); spliced timeline +
  un-paused linked-thread graph for B2B.

---

## 6. Pre-launch blockers (need a real domain first)

> For the **soft** launch all three are skipped — everyone is free tier, no emails, no payments.
> They gate only the **paid/public** launch (L2).

- **Resend:** `DIGEST_FROM_EMAIL` must be a verified domain → buy domain → verify → set it.
- **Paddle:** needs a live website URL to finish merchant setup → set `PADDLE_API_KEY`,
  `PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PADDLE_PRICE_PRO`, `PADDLE_PRICE_POWER`.
- **Clerk:** switch dev instance (`integral-grackle-67…`) → production instance.

---

## 7. Locked decisions & red lights (from the architecture)

- **One surface, radical subtraction** — the brief *is* the home feed; topics are a filter, not a
  sidebar of dots. "All caught up" is a hero state.
- **"New to us" ≠ "new to the world"** (red light, verified live) — the feed must gate on development
  recency (§8B / 1a.5), not `first_seen_at`. This is the single biggest quality leak.
- **Lead with the lede; tallies are background; show a "state of play"** (red light, 2026-06-19 GPT
  benchmark) — rank by `event_class` not flat importance; collapse running totals; surface a grounded
  status block. The GPT head-to-head beat us on signal/synthesis — fix via §2.5 (IC1–IC8).
- **Story graph stays paused** — keep the code, stop the spend; revisit only for B2B, and only as a
  loose locally-queried graph, never a global tree, never load-bearing for dedup.
- **Briefer is removed from the live path** — assemble `fact`+`context`; keep generation only for the
  polished email digest.
- **Model choice always lives in `settings`/`LLMClient`** — never hardcoded. Run on Gemini Flash, not
  Claude (cost at per-scan volume).
- **North-star: precision@5 ≥ 80%** — below ~60% churn is guaranteed regardless of UI; build A.2 first.
